## Pipeline Testing

The nf-gwas pipeline uses the new [nf-test](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test) framework for writing tests. It supports tests for individual Nextflow processes as well as tests for the overall pipeline or workflow. Click [here](https://github.com/genepi/nf-gwas/tree/main/tests) for currently included tests.
