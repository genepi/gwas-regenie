## Running the GWAS-Regenie Nextflow pipeline: Lessons learned from a biologist

*or: From zero command line knowledge to running a genome-wide association study in no time*

Earlier this year we contacted our colleague [Johanna](https://twitter.com/johsr2) to present her our current status of the GWAS pipeline using Nextflow. In this tutorial, she summarizes her first steps with Nextflow and executing the pipeline on remote infrastructure.

The goal of this tutorial is to get started with the GWAS-regenie pipeline **without prior knowledge of Nextflow**.
