##  Introduction

Programs to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are usually run via the command line. This can be intimidating for a biologist. Take me as an example: in my bachelor and master I've studied molecular medicine. So my formal training focused on understanding pathophysiological processes in the human body and how to perform wet-lab experiments, I never had to use the command line. Nevertheless, I was able to run my first GWAS using the nf-gwas pipeline.

Here, I want to first introduce this pipeline through the lens of a biologist (see section [Pipeline Overview](https://genepi.github.io/nf-gwas/gwas-regenie-101/pipeline-overview.html)) and second share with you *my setup*.
Since I am working on a Windows computer, I need to access a remote Linux server to run the pipeline. So the section [Mastering the basic tasks](https://genepi.github.io/nf-gwas/gwas-regenie-101/basic-tasks.html) will be about the kind of tasks that are *so basic that bioinformaticians don't even talk about them*. I guess this is like describing how to pipet for a trained wet-lab biologist.

However, I hope it will show you that if you follow these steps you can run your first GWAS without any prior knowledge in bioinformatics in no time :).
