## Conclusion

So to conclude, you don't need profound bioinformatics or command line knowledge to run your first GWAS. If I was able to do it, you can too :). In short, you only need:

1. Access to a Linux server, cluster or computer
2. A SSH client (e.g. Windows PowerShell) to navigate within the server and to execute commands
3. A multi-platform FTP client (e.g. FileZilla) to transfer files from your computer to the server and vice versa
4. The commands listed in Table 1 to navigate via the command line and to run your GWAS
